## State-based Microbe Simulation

## What is this? ðŸ¤”

- A simulation for microbes mating and reproducing and eating
- Microbes can also attract a sugar cube toward them if they are seeking it
- Once they eat cube they may not be killed but can still die if they out of bounds
- Power up duration depends on type of power up
- invincibility: lasts 10 seconds 
- Agent-modal: state-based reflex 

### Future implementation 
- different colour cube power-up - possibly control 
- rabbit reproduction: increase reproduction rate dramatically
- eagle mode: increase pull strength
- cheetah mode: increase max acceleration and and speed 



## Quick Start :rocket:

1. Create a new project in unity
2. Clone this repository in the root project folder
3. Delete sample scene from your Unity project if it exists and switch to the Microbes scene in the scene folder
4. Press Play
