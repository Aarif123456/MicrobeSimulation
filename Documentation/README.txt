A simulation for microbes mating and reproducing and eating
Microbes can also attract a sugar cube toward them if they are seeking it
Once they eat cube they may not be killed but can still die if they out of bounds
Power up duration depends on type of power up
invincibility: lasts 10 seconds 

Agent-modal - state-based reflex 

Future implementation 
- different color cube power-up - possibly control 
- rabbit reproduction: increase reproduction rate dramatically
- eagle mode: increase pull strength
- cheetah mode: increase max acceleration and and speed
